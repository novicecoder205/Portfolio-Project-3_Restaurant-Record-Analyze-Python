# Project title: "Restaurant Records Analysis"
<br>
### Introduction: 
As a data analyst, I was approached by the owners of a local mom-and-pop restaurant who were growing increasingly concerned about rising operational costs. They needed someone to thoroughly examine their order records and uncover insights that could help them manage expenses more effectively. Let me walk you through how I approached and implemented this analysis.<br>

<br>
### Primary Goal:
Using Python to identify:

1. The most popular dishes.
   
2. Busiest order times.
   
3. Opportunies to streamline operations. 

There are two csv files to analyze: orders.csv and menu_items.csv, this project will require the use of both to answers the two main questions that is crucial for a business operation.

1# What items drives the most and least revenue?

2# Which time periods have the highest and lowest revenue?
